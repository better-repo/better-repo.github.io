# [/mjg/ Repository](https://better-repo.github.io)

Fork of [maajan repo](https://repo.riichi.moe) for the [maajan general](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/catalog#s=mjg). Removed anon's cringe fetish cluttering the main and library pages, and some unused files.

[**/mjg/ Repo Constitution**](https://github.com/better-repo/better-repo.github.io/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md) Of historical interest. This fork is under the sole management of the organization owner. If you wish to contribute to this fork specifically, open a pull request, but there's no guarantee it will be upstreamed to here or the original repo.
